# Implemented Improvement Pass

This pass addressed the ten self-review items from the first working version.

1. File-backed Web job queue under `library/jobs`, with startup recovery.
2. Per-song file locks around pipeline stages.
3. Demucs output streamed to `library/work/{song_id}/logs/separate.log`.
4. Web routes split from server-rendered views.
5. Subtitle timing can be shifted without rerunning alignment.
6. Separation writes a basic WAV quality report for mix, instrumental, and vocals.
7. Probe and audio-track selection now fail early on invalid media/track choices.
8. Demucs has an opt-in slow smoke test gated by `KTV_RUN_SLOW=1`.
9. Ruff linting and GitHub Actions CI are configured.
10. Library management supports `clean-work` and `delete` from CLI and Web.
